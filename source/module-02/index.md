## Overview

!!!time "Estimated Reading Time"
	Plan on around 90 - 120 minutes for this preparation reading, which consists of a mix of online and textbook reading.

The objective of this module is to provide a real-world scenario in which you can practice the following data science / machine learning skills:

* Assessing Data Quality
* Investigating Feature Relationships
* Scaling and Normalization
* Ethics
* Unsupervised Learning and K-Means Clustering

## Preparation Reading

Complete the following preparation reading:

* Read sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.6 of your text. (You've already read section 3.5, but feel free to review it.)

* Watch the following introduction to Cluster Analysis:
