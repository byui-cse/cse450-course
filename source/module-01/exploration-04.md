## Overview

In this data exploration, you will:

* Perform some probability calculations.

Throughout this exploration, when you're asked to use a new function or library, we'll usually provide a link to that function's documentation, or a tutorial related to it.

## Introduction

As with our previous data explorations, this assignment uses [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com). For more information on using Google Colab, including how to submit assignments with it, please see the information in [Data Exploration 01](./exploration-01.html) 

## Assignment

A [political think tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank) is preparing a public relations campain on a variety of policy issues. 

In order to understand how they should best allocate their time, they've asked you to calculate some probabilities based on prior Congressional voting history.

Click on the `Open In Colab` button below to open a Google Colab notebook with the template for this assignment. Once you've completed the assignment, upload the notebook to a Github Gist, then paste the URL to the gist into the assignment submission form on Canvas.
