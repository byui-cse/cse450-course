## Module 01 - Overview

This week you'll get an introduction to the different areas of machine learning, review (or learn) some basic statistics that data scientists use every day, and dive in to some tools and libraries used by professionals.

The exact rhythm of the assignments in this module will depend on your [course delivery method](https://www.byui.edu/registration/when-do-i-register/fall-registration-guide), as described below.

	Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class and Canvas announcements.

### Module 01 Rhythm

Students will complete a foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, the instructor will review the material and answer questions. 

Students will then work in temporary groups during class to complete data exploration assignments. Online student teams will use Zoom breakout rooms for their meetings.

At the end of module one, students will take an assessment quiz. The main purpose of this quiz is to help students decide if they are adequately prepared to continue in the course.

Students who elect to continue with the course will then be assigned to permanent groups for the remainder of the semester.
