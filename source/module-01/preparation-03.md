	Plan on around 30 to 60 minutes for this preparation reading, which consists of textbook reading.

## Introduction

Looking at descriptive statistics can be a great way to understand a particular feature. But often what we're most interested in is the relationships between features. 

There are some quantitative ways to look at those relationships that we'll learn about later in the semester, but often looking at feature relationships visually can help you decide what direction to take on the rest of the analysis.

When creating visualizations to present the findings from your analysis, it is important to recognize the difference between data exploration and data presentation.
