## Overview

The objective of this module is to provide a real-world scenario in which you can practice using Recurrent Neural Networks.

!!!time "Estimated Reading Time"
	Plan on around 120 - 240 minutes for this preparation reading, which consists of online reading and videos.

## Preparation Reading

!!!note "Theory vs Practice"
	There is a lot of content to read this week. For the sake of the preparation quiz and Friday's discussion, you should go through everything in the *Theory* section below.

	The items in the *Practical* section are things you'll want to go through before you start in on the actual case study work on Monday.

### Theory

Please go through this content before the reading quiz and class discussion on Friday:

#### Recurrent Neural Networks

First, read the following article that introduces how Recurrent Neural Networks work. But, ignore the code examples, because the article uses an older version of TensorFlow:

* [Recurrent Neural Networks and Super Mario](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-2-a26a10b68df3)

Next, watch this video from MIT, which dives a little deeper into the concepts of how recurrent neural networks work, and how they can be used to solve machine learning problems.

### Practical
Please go through this content before class on Monday:

* Read [this page about RNNs](./keras-rnn.html)
* Read [this page about Temperature](https://medium.com/@harshit158/softmax-temperature-5492e4007f71)
* Explore [this site about embeddings](https://projector.tensorflow.org/)
