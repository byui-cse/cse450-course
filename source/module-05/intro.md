## Introduction
You've been hired by WelcomeBike Bike Rentals in Beijing to build a neural network that will predict the number of bike rentals for a given day. [^1]

## Stakeholders

These are the individuals your team will be helping during the case study:

	<h5>Zhao, CEO of WelcomeBike</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Our bicycle rental business is taking off. I'm excited to see how machine learning can help us to avoid the mistakes of our competitors and prove to our investors that we have a winning business model.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

	<h5>William, Investment Banker</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Oh...it's <em>you</em> again.</p><p>Nearly every Chinese bike rental business anyone has invested in has gone bankrupt.</p><p>Mr. Zhao seems to think that AI can make all the difference, and our bank's investment board is curious to find out if he's right.</p><p>I'm here by their request to witness his failure—I mean, to see how it goes.</p></blockquote>

	<h5>Johnny, Data Science Intern</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Hey, small world!</p><p>I'm visiting my grandmother in Shanghai and thought I'd stop by and see how you're doing.</p>
	</blockquote>
