## CSE 450 Course Overview

Welcome to CSE 450 - Machine Learning and Data Mining.

The goal of this course is to help you: 

* Be excited about machine learning and data mining.
* Have the ability to tackle a real dataset and do something interesting 
   with it.
* Be prepared to start a graduate level experience, class, or project in 
   machine learning / data mining.
* Understand current challenges and limitations in the field.

## Data Sources

This course uses datasets in the public domain or under a compatible license. Citations and other information for each dataset may be found on the [course data sources page](./data-sources.html).

## Course Structure

This course is divided into seven *modules*. Each module will last approximately two weeks (six class periods). Modules begin on Wednesdays.

Module 01 is designed to quickly bring you up to speed on the foundational knowledge and vocabulary you will need to succeed in the rest of the course. 

Modules 02 - 07 use a series of case studies to help you learn to understand and apply a variety of machine learning techniques. 

The exact rhythm of the assignments in each module will depend on your [course delivery method](https://www.byui.edu/registration/when-do-i-register/fall-registration-guide), as described below.

!!! warning "Subject to Change"
	
	Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class and Canvas announcements.

### Module 01

Students will complete a foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, the instructor will review the material and answer questions. 

Students will then work in temporary groups during class to complete data exploration assignments. Online student teams will use Zoom breakout rooms for their meetings.

At the end of module one, students will take an assessment quiz. The main purpose of this quiz is to help students decide if they are adequately prepared to continue in the course.

Students who elect to continue with the course will then be assigned to permanent groups for the remainder of the semester.

### Modules 02 - 07

For classroom delivery, modules 02 - 07 will each follow this pattern:

*Day 1 (Wednesday)* - We'll introduce the module's topic, and discuss a case study related to it.

*Day 2 (Friday)* - Students will complete the `Prepare` reading before coming to class. In class, they will complete an individual assessment quiz, and a team assessment quiz. 

After the quizzes, the instructor will introduce a new case study related to the topic. During the rest of Day 2, teams will spend time evaluating the case study, and making decisions about the questions posed.

*Day 3 (Monday)* - During the first half of the class, teams will continue working on their evaluation of the case study. During the second half of the class, each team will have five to seven minutes to present their conclusions and defend their choices.

We'll then introduce a new case study related to the topic. Teams will have until Saturday at midnight to perform any necessary data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and visualizations; and to write up their results and conclusions in a formal summary.

Class time will be given to help coordinate this work on Days 4 and 5 (Wednesday and Friday), but students are expected to spend significant time outside of class working on these assignments.

*Day 6* (Monday): Each team will present and defend their recommendations to the rest of the class.
