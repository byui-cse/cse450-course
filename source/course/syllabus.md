## CSE 450 Course Overview

Welcome to CSE 450 - Machine Learning and Data Mining.

The goal of this course is to help you: 

* Be excited about machine learning and data mining.
* Have the ability to tackle a real dataset and do something interesting with it.
* Be prepared to start a graduate level experience, class, or project in machine learning / data mining.
* Understand current challenges and limitations in the field.

!!!note "Course Textbook"

	The textbook for this course is [Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Analytics/dp/0262029448) by Kelleher, Mac Namee, and D'Arcy; 1st Edition.

	You may access [this text book online for free via Proquest](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/byui/detail.action?docID=6246595), courtesy of the BYU-Idaho library.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into seven *modules*. Each module will last approximately two weeks (six class periods). Modules begin on Wednesdays.

!!! warning "Subject to Change"
	
	Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class and Canvas announcements.

!!!note "Time Expectations" 
	University guidelines suggest that students spend an average of three hours per week per credit hour.

	While there will be some time provided in class for team assignments, as this is a three credit course, the expectation is that students will spend an average of six hours per week on assignments outside of class, including the time spent on preparation readings.


Each module is worth a percentage of your final grade:

### Module 01

Module 01 is designed to quickly bring you up to speed on the foundational knowledge and vocabulary you will need to succeed in the rest of the course. 

#### Preparation Reading Quizzes

Before each class session of Module 01, you will complete a Preparation Reading, followed by an associated quiz.

You may take each quiz as many times as you like until its due date. You must score at least 90% on a quiz to receive credit for it. 

If you take a quiz multiple times, the highest passing score you receive will be your final score for that quiz.

At the start of class, the instructor will briefly review the material and answer questions from the reading, but will assume that you have already completed the reading.

#### Data Explorations

After reviewing the reading, you will work in temporary groups during class to complete hands-on, Data Exploration assignments. Online students will use Zoom breakout rooms.

!!!note "Data Exploration Evaluations"

	In order to receive credit for a Data Exploration, each student must fill out a Data Exploration Evaluation in Canvas, according to the instructions provided.

	One of the questions in the evaluation will ask you to rate your team's performance. Another will ask you to rate your personal performance. 

	Your personal grade for each Data Exploration will then be calculated as:

	    75% of Team + 25% of Individual ± Instructor's Evaluation


#### Individual Exploration

At the end of Module 01, you will complete an Individual Exploration assignment that will test your Module 01 knowledge as well as your ability to apply that knowledge through a series of exercises. 

This assessment will be done outside of class and should take approximately two hours to complete.

Its main purpose is to help you decide if you are adequately prepared to continue in the course. 

Students who elect to continue with the course will be assigned to permanent teams for the remainder of the semester.



### Modules 02 - 07

Modules 02 - 07 use case studies to help students learn to understand and apply a variety of machine learning techniques. Each module will follow this pattern:

#### Day 1 (Wednesday)
 We'll introduce the module's topic, and discuss an introductory case study related to it.

#### Day 2 (Friday)
Students will complete the module reading assignment before coming to class. 

In class, each student will complete a timed, individual readiness assessment (iRAT).

After the individual assessment, teams will work together to complete an identical team readiness assessment (tRAT).

After the readiness assessments, the instructor will introduce the module's `Minor Case Study` assignment. 

Students will spend any remaining time on Day 2 evaluating this case study, and making decisions about the questions posed.

#### Day 3 (Monday)
During the first half of the class, teams will continue working on the questions posed in the `Minor Case Study`. 

During the second half of the class, each team will have five to seven minutes to present their conclusions and defend their choices.

We'll then introduce the module's `Major Case Study`.

!!!note "Minor Case Study Reflection"

	In order to receive credit for the Minor Case Study, *each* student must submit a personal Minor Case Study Reflection by Tuesday at midnight.


#### Days 4 and 5 (Wednesday and Friday)
Teams will have until *Saturday at midnight* to perform any necessary data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and visualizations related to the `Major Case Study`.

Each case study will include a formal Executive Summary Report template to guide them through this process.

Students are required to meet in class to help coordinate this work, but are also expected to do significant work outside of class on this assignment.

Students must submit their Executive Summary Report (one per team) by Saturday at midnight.

#### Day 6 (Monday)
Each team will present and defend their `Major Case Study` report to the rest of the class. 

This presentation will form a major part of the Instructor's evaluation for the `Major Case Study`.

!!!note "Major Case Study Reflection"

	In order to receive credit for a case study, *each* student must submit a personal Major Case Study Reflection by Monday at midnight.

	One of the questions in the reflection will ask you to assess your team's performance on the case study. Another will ask you to assess your personal performance on the case study. 

	Your personal grade for the major case study will be calculated as:

	    75% of Team + 25% of Individual ± Instructor's Evaluation


## Grading

## Late Policy

Because of the team-based, interactive nature of this course, no late credit is given. 

In the event of an *extreme emergency* that prevents you from communicating with your team in *any possible way known to mankind*, your instructor will work with you to come up with a way for you to make up the content of a given module.

Note that the following are *not* considered extreme emergencies:

* Marriages, Family Reunions, Bar Mitzvahs, Quinceaneros, Temple Trips, or other celebratory events.
* Having to work
* Oversleeping
* A broken or malfunctioning computer, Internet connection, or other technical issue.
* Suffering from any illness other than one that a doctor's note states has immobilized you in such a way that you are unable to communicate with your teammates via video or chat.
* Being quarantined or otherwise physically stranded in a location that has any possibility for a sufficiently desperate person to acquire Internet access.


## Academic Honesty
You are expected to follow [the university's policies for academic honesty](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty).

You may work with your classmates but all submitted work for projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant.

If you work closely with another student, helping teach and learn from each other, make sure you each still write your own code, but in this case, your solutions may end up being very similar. This is completely fine, but please make sure to put a comment in your code stating that you wrote your own program, but worked closely with that person, and that is why it is similar.

You are encouraged to use the Internet as a resource, but recognize that you should not copy and paste someone else’s work as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. When in doubt, give credit and be upfront.

Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" Internet sites.

The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the University.

## Dress and Grooming
You are expected to follow the university's [Dress and Grooming Standards](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming)

This includes any [current university requirements and/or guidelines](https://www.byui.edu/covid-19-updates) related to wearing masks and/or social distancing.

## Grievance Policy
Review the [Academic Student Grievance Policy](http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/SJ8pMAmZr?bc=true&bcCurrent=Student%20Grievance&bcGroup=Academic%20Grievance%20Policy&bcItemType=policies).

## Student Support
Support is available in many ways including via other class members and discussion in Slack. In addition, help is available through [the university's academic support center](http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers).

## Sexual Harassment
BYU-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe and respectful environment for the campus community. Sexual misconduct is against the law, contrary to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Honor Code and inconsistent with the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, which we hope are embodied on our campus. The university prohibits sexual misconduct perpetrated by or against university students, university employees, participants in university programs, or visitors to its campus, whether the behavior occurs on or off campus.
