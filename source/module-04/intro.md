## Introduction
WelcomeBike Bike Rentals is a Beijing-based bike rental company that has recently expanded to include a handful of US locations. You've been asked to build a neural network that will predict the number of bike rentals for a given day and hour for their Washington DC branch. [^1]

## Stakeholders

These are the individuals your team will be helping during the case study:

	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/zhao.jpg">
	<h5>Zhao, CEO of WelcomeBike</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Our new DC branch is taking off again after COVID-19. I'm excited to see how machine learning can help us to avoid the mistakes of our competitors and prove to our investors that we have a winning business model.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/william.jpg">
	<h5>William, Investment Banker</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Oh...it's <em>you</em> again.</p><p>Nearly every Chinese bike rental business anyone has invested in has gone bankrupt.</p><p>Mr. Zhao seems to think that AI can make all the difference, and our bank's investment board is curious to find out if he's right.</p><p>I'm here by their request to witness his failure—I mean, to see how it goes.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">

	<h5>Johnny, Data Science Intern</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Hey, small world!</p><p>I'm visiting my grandma Peggy in Langley, Virginia and thought I'd stop by the capital and see how you're doing.</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>

!!!note "Stakeholder Focus Areas"
	The stakeholders are particularly interested in the following areas:

	1.	Building a neural network that can predict the number of bicycle rentals for a given day.
	2.  Understanding how weather, holidays, and other factors affect revenue.

You've been invited to a strategy meeting tomorrow.
