## Introduction
You’re working as a data analyst for Reddic Housing LLC, a company that specializes in providing house price estimates to development firms.

Recently, a rival company (Grenic Housing Inc) announced that they were launching a set of initiatives to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to bring their housing estimates into the twenty-first century.

After a heated shareholders meeting, the board of directors has tasked the CEO with making sure Reddic Housing LLC isn’t left behind.

## Stakeholders

These are the individuals your team will be helping during the case study.

	<h5>Cecil, the VP of Customer Relations</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Hello, I'm Cecil the Vice President of Customer Relations.</p>
	<p>Our customers are particularly interested in the amount of confidence they can place in our estimates. It's one thing to say a property should be valued at a certain price, but something else to say how sure we are about that.</blockquote>

	<h5>William, the VP of Finance</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Charmed.</p>
	<p>I'll admit, I'm a bit skeptical of this so-called "data science". I like my data kept in Excel spreadsheets where I can keep an eye on it.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dialogue">

	<h5>Devon, the CEO</h5>
	<blockquote><p>It's good to finally have you on the team. I can't wait to see what you can do for Reddic Housing</p>
		<p>I graduated from Stanford five years ago, launched a VC-backed startup that was later acquired by Reddic Housing, and was named the CEO by the new board of directors.</p></blockquote>

	<h5>Johnny, the data science intern</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Hey!</p>
		<p>I can't believe we're working together again! This is going to be awesome!</p>
	</blockquote>

You're about to go into a strategy meeting with the CEO, Vice President of Customer Relations, and Vice President of Finance. They want to make sure you have the data required to answer the questions they're most interested in.
