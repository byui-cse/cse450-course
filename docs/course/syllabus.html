		<h2 id="cse-450-course-overview">CSE 450 Course Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to CSE 450 - Machine Learning and Data Mining.</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to help you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Be excited about machine learning and data mining.</li>
<li>Have the ability to tackle a real dataset and do something interesting with it.</li>
<li>Be prepared to start a graduate level experience, class, or project in machine learning / data mining.</li>
<li>Understand current challenges and limitations in the field.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Course Textbook</p>
<p>The textbook for this course is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Analytics/dp/0262029448">Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics</a> by Kelleher, Mac Namee, and D'Arcy; 1st Edition.</p>
<p>You may access <a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/byui/detail.action?docID=6246595">this text book online for free via Proquest</a>, courtesy of the BYU-Idaho library.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course is divided into seven <em>modules</em>. Each module will last approximately two weeks (six class periods). Modules begin on Wednesdays.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Subject to Change</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class and Canvas announcements.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="module-01">Module 01</h3>
<p>Module 01 is designed to quickly bring you up to speed on the foundational knowledge and vocabulary you will need to succeed in the rest of the course. Hopefully, most of the math, statistics, and coding topics covered in Module 01 are a review.</p>
<p>Before each class session, students will complete a foundational reading assignment. During class, the instructor will review the material and answer questions. </p>
<p>Students will then work in temporary groups during class to complete data exploration assignments. Online students will use Zoom breakout rooms.</p>
<p>At the end of Module 01, students will complete a personal assessment assignment. The main purpose of this assignment is to help students decide if they are adequately prepared to continue in the course.</p>
<p>Students who elect to continue with the course will then be assigned to permanent groups for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<h3 id="modules-02-07">Modules 02 - 07</h3>
<p>Modules 02 - 07 use case studies to help students learn to understand and apply a variety of machine learning techniques. Each module will follow this pattern:</p>
<p><em>Day 1 (Wednesday)</em> - We'll introduce the module's topic, and discuss an introductory case study related to it.</p>
<p><em>Day 2 (Friday)</em> - Students will complete the module reading assignment before coming to class. In class, they will complete an individual readiness assessment (iRAT), and a team readiness assessment (tRAT).</p>
<p>After the assessments, the instructor will introduce the module's <code>Minor Case Study</code>. During the rest of Day 2, teams will spend time evaluating the case study, and making decisions about the questions posed.</p>
<p><em>Day 3 (Monday)</em> - During the first half of the class, teams will continue working on the questions posed in the <code>Minor Case Study</code>. During the second half of the class, each team will have five to seven minutes to present their conclusions and defend their choices.</p>
<p>We'll then introduce the module's <code>Major Case Study</code>. Teams will have until <em>Saturday at midnight</em> to perform any necessary data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and visualizations; and to write up their results and conclusions in a formal summary.</p>
<p>Class time will be given during the week to help coordinate this work on Days 4 and 5, (Wednesday and Friday), but students are expected to spend significant time outside of class working on the major case study.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Time Expectations</p>
<p>University guidelines suggest that students should spend an average of three hours per week outside of class per credit hour. </p>
<p>As this is a three credit course, the expectation is that students will spend an average of nine hours per week on assignments outside of class, including the time spent on preparation readings.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Day 6</em> (Monday): Each team will present and defend their recommendations to the rest of the class.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Letter grades are given according to the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system">standard BYU-Idaho grading scale</a>.</p>
<p>Each module is worth a percentage of your final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Module 01: 10% of Final Grade</li>
<li>Modules 02 - 07: 15% of Final Grade Each</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module-01-assessments">Module 01 Assessments</h3>
<p>Module 01's assignments are weighted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation Reading Quizzes: 30% of module grade</li>
<li>Data Explorations: 60% of module grade</li>
<li>Personal Assessment Assignment: 10% of module grade</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation Reading Quizzes</h4>
<p>Each of the preparation readings has an associated quiz designed to make sure you understood the key points of the reading. </p>
<p>You may take each quiz as many times as you like until its due date. You must score at least 90% on a quiz to receive credit for it. </p>
<p>If you take a quiz multiple times, the highest passing score you receive will be your final score for that quiz.</p>
<h4>Data Explorations</h4>
<p>After completing a data exploration as a team, each student fills out a <a href="./data-exploration-evaluation.docx">Data Exploration Evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>To receive credit for a case study, students must completely fill out  evaluation according to the instructions provided. </p>
<p>One of the questions in the evaluation will ask you to rate your team's performance on the case study. Another will ask you to rate your personal performance on the case study. </p>
<p>Your instructor will review your evaluation and optionally make adjustments to each score according to their observations.</p>
<p>Your personal grade for the Data Exploration will then be calculated as:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>(Team Score * .75) + (Individual Score * .25)</code></pre>


<h4>Personal Assessment Assignment</h4>
<p>The Personal Assessment Assignment will test your Module 01 knowledge as well as your ability to apply that knowledge through a series of exercises.</p>
<p>This assessment will be done outside of class and will take approximately two hours to complete.</p>
<h3 id="module-02-07-assessments">Module 02 - 07 Assessments</h3>
<p>Modules 02 - 07's assignments are weighted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual Readiness Assessments: 17% of module grade</li>
<li>Team Readiness Assessments: 3% of module grade</li>
<li>Minor Case Study: 30% of module grade</li>
<li>Major Case Study: 50% of module grade</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation Readiness Assessments</h4>
<p>Each student will complete an individual readiness assessment (iRAT) on the second day of each module. These are timed, in-class quizzes.</p>
<p>After the individual assessment, teams will work together to complete an identical team readiness assessment (tRAT).</p>
<h4>Case Studies</h4>
<p>After completing a case study, each student fills out a <a href="./case-study-evaluation.docx">Case Study Evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>To receive credit for a case study, students must completely fill out the case study evaluation according to the instructions provided. </p>
<p>One of the questions in the evaluation will ask you to assess your team's performance on the case study. Another will ask you to assess your personal performance on the case study. </p>
<p>Your instructor will review your assessment and optionally make adjustments to each score according to their observations.</p>
<p>Your personal grade for the case study will then be calculated as:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>(Team Score * .75) + (Individual Score * .25)</code></pre>


<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>
<p>Because of the team-based, interactive nature of this course, no late credit is given. </p>
<p>In the event of an <em>extreme emergency</em> that prevents you from communicating with your team in <em>any possible way known to mankind</em>, your instructor will work with you to come up with a way for you to make up the content of a given module.</p>
<p>Note that the following are <em>not</em> considered extreme emergencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marriages, Family Reunions, Bar Mitzvahs, Quinceaneros, Temple Trips, or other celebratory events.</li>
<li>Having to work</li>
<li>Oversleeping</li>
<li>A broken or malfunctioning computer, Internet connection, or other technical issue.</li>
<li>Suffering from any illness other than one that a doctor's note states has immobilized you in such a way that you are unable to communicate with your teammates via video or chat.</li>
<li>Being quarantined or otherwise physically stranded in a location that has any possibility for a sufficiently desperate person to acquire Internet access.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are expected to follow <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty">the university's policies for academic honesty</a>.</p>
<p>You may work with your classmates but all submitted work for projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant.</p>
<p>If you work closely with another student, helping teach and learn from each other, make sure you each still write your own code, but in this case, your solutions may end up being very similar. This is completely fine, but please make sure to put a comment in your code stating that you wrote your own program, but worked closely with that person, and that is why it is similar.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to use the Internet as a resource, but recognize that you should not copy and paste someone else’s work as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. When in doubt, give credit and be upfront.</p>
<p>Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" Internet sites.</p>
<p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the University.</p>
<h2 id="dress-and-grooming">Dress and Grooming</h2>
<p>You are expected to follow the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>
<p>This includes any <a href="https://www.byui.edu/covid-19-updates">current university requirements and/or guidelines</a> related to wearing masks and/or social distancing.</p>

<h2 id="student-support">Student Support</h2>
<p>Support is available in many ways including via other class members and discussion in Slack. In addition, help is available through <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers">the university's academic support center</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sexual-harassment">Sexual Harassment</h2>
<p>BYU-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe and respectful environment for the campus community. Sexual misconduct is against the law, contrary to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Honor Code and inconsistent with the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, which we hope are embodied on our campus. The university prohibits sexual misconduct perpetrated by or against university students, university employees, participants in university programs, or visitors to its campus, whether the behavior occurs on or off campus.</p>
