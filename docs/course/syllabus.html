<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Course Textbook</p>
<p>The textbook for this course is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Analytics/dp/0262029448">Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics</a> by Kelleher, Mac Namee, and D'Arcy; 1st Edition.</p>
<p>You may access <a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/byui/detail.action?docID=6246595">this text book online for free via Proquest</a>, courtesy of the BYU-Idaho library.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course is divided into seven <em>modules</em>. Each module will last approximately two weeks (six class periods for campus students). Most of these modules, modules one through six, will be completed as teams.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Subject to Change</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class, MS Teams, and Canvas announcements.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Time Expectations</p>
<p>University guidelines suggest that students spend an average of three hours per week per credit hour.</p>
<p>While there will be some time provided in class for team assignments for campus students, as this is a three credit course, the expectation is that students will spend an average of six hours per week on assignments outside of class, including the time spent on preparation readings.</p>
</div>
<p>Each module is worth a percentage of your final grade:</p>
<h3 id="module-01">Module 01</h3>
<p>Module 01 is designed to quickly bring you up to speed on the foundational knowledge and vocabulary you will need to succeed in the rest of the course. </p>
<h4 id="preparation-reading-quizzes">Preparation Reading Quizzes</h4>
<p>For each data exploration in Module 01, you will complete a Preparation Reading, followed by an associated quiz.</p>
<p>You may take each quiz as many times as you like until its due date. You must score at least 90% on a quiz to receive credit for it. </p>
<p>If you take a quiz multiple times, the highest passing score you receive will be your final score for that quiz.</p>
<p>At the start of class for campus students, the instructor will briefly review the material and answer questions from the reading, but will assume that you have already completed the reading. Online students may send questions to the instructor or other classmates after completing the reading.</p>
<h4 id="data-explorations">Data Explorations</h4>
<p>After reviewing the reading, you will work in temporary groups during class for campus students to complete hands-on, Data Exploration assignments. Online students will use Microsoft Teams meetings.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Data Exploration Evaluations</p>
<p>In order to receive credit for a Data Exploration, each student must fill out a Data Exploration Evaluation in Canvas, according to the instructions provided.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="individual-exploration">Individual Exploration</h4>
<p>At the end of Module 01, you will complete an Individual Exploration assignment that will test your Module 01 knowledge as well as your ability to apply that knowledge through a series of exercises. </p>
<p>This assessment will be done outside of class and should take approximately two hours to complete.</p>
<p>Its main purpose is to help you decide if you are adequately prepared to continue in the course. </p>
<p>Students who elect to continue with the course will be assigned to permanent teams for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<h3 id="modules-02-06">Modules 02 - 06</h3>
<p>Modules 02 - 06 use case studies to help students learn to understand and apply a variety of machine learning techniques. </p>
<p>Each module lasts approximately two weeks and follows a case-study format. Each case study is designed to provide students with a real world backdrop to learn and apply machine learning tools.</p>
<p>Students will work in teams to create a report designed to answer the questions posed by the case study. Students will then present their work to the class. Online students will post videos and campus students will present in class. Students will then have an opportunity to reflect on their own and their teammates performance and contributions. </p>
<h3 id="modules-07">Modules 07</h3>
<p>Module 07 provides an opportunity for students to apply machine learning techniques to a personally selected project.</p>
<p>Students will have a week to work individually on a dataset of their choice. Students will demonstrate their ability to work with a dataset from start to finish, using the skills aquired in the course. Students will select a dataset, pre-process the data, generate visuals, apply machine learning techniques, evaluate findings, and write an executive summary as a final project.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>See your Canvas section for exact grade weights for each assignment, but in general, assignments are weighted similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Module 01 - Machine Learning Introduction: 10%</li>
<li>Module 02-06 - Case Study Preparation: 10%</li>
<li>Module 02-06 - Case Study Executive Summaries: 40%</li>
<li>Module 02-06 - Case Study Personal Contribution: 20%</li>
<li>Module 02-05 - Case Study Holdout Predictions: 10%</li>
<li>Module 07 - Individual Case Study: 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Final Letter grades are given according to the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system">standard BYU-Idaho grading scale</a>.</p>
<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>
<p>Because of the team-based, interactive nature of this course, no late credit is given. </p>
<p>In the event of an <em>extreme emergency</em> that prevents you from communicating with your team, your instructor will work with you to come up with a way for you to make up the content of a given module.</p>
<p>Note that the following are <em>not</em> considered extreme emergencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marriages, Family Reunions, Bar Mitzvahs, Quinceaneros, Temple Trips, or other celebratory events.</li>
<li>Having to work</li>
<li>Oversleeping</li>
<li>A broken or malfunctioning computer, Internet connection, or other technical issue.</li>
<li>Suffering from any illness that keeps you home but still allows you to reach out via Teams, Zoom, or Slack</li>
<li>Being quarantined</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you are honest in every way, you are able to enjoy peace of mind and maintain self-respect. You build strength of character, which allows you to be of service to God and others. You are trustworthy in the eyes of God and those around you. If you are dishonest in your words or actions, you hurt yourself and often hurt others as well. If you lie, steal, cheat, or neglect to give the full amount of work for your pay, you lose your self-respect. You lose the guidance of the Holy Ghost” (“Honesty,” True to the Faith (2004), 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Academic Honesty means students do their own work. This also means their instructors will evaluate that work. Students should not be dishonest—this includes all types of work in their courses. The complete Academic Honesty Policy can be found at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty">http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty</a>.</p>
